          <desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.&#xA;&#xA;By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.&#xA;&#xA;There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.&#xA;&#xA;Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>

          <desc>Alien is a video game based on the movie of the same name. The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161.

          <desc>Reggie Jackson Baseball (American Baseball in Japan and PAL countries) is, as the name implies, a simulation of USA&#39;s most beloved sports: baseball. There are four modes in the game: Exhibition, Tournament, Watch Mode, and finally a Home Run Contest. In the Watch Mode the computer just plays against itself, and in Tournament Mode you compete against the computer. The other two modes can be played against computer or a human opponent as well.&#xA;&#xA;You can choose Major League Baseball teams in all of those modes. During the game, the player controls the pitcher and the batter from a third-person view; the view changes to top-down after a strike by a batter, so that the player can view a large part of the field. Events such as injuries or cheerleader performances are graphically shown in the game.</desc>

In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as Astrix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Astrix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Oblix is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).&#xA;&#xA;Astrix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls Dogmatix.

          <desc>Two games on one cartridge:&#xA;&#xA;Pit Pot: The Magical Castle The princess has been kidnapped. To rescue her, navigate your way through each room while avoiding its inhabitants such as dragons and guards. If necessary, use your magical hammer to knock them off the screen. You can also knock a gray tile that they are on to cause them to fall down and die. You exit each room by passing through doors, but you have to find a golden key that will unlock some of them. &#xA;&#xA;Astro Warrior Blast your way through three zones, including Galaxy Zone, Asteroid Zone, and Nebula Zone. Enemies will start making their way down the screen, but you only have bullets to deal with them. There are flashing points on the terrain in which you can shoot at, Shooting enough of these will cause a number of green ships, which when destroyed, will upgrade your firepower. At the end of each zone, you come face to face with a boss, and it is likely that you are going to need that extra firepower.</desc>

          <desc>Basic Sega shoot-em-up in which you must guide your ship through three zones while avoiding hazards. Your only weapon are bullets as your only defense, but if you shoot the flashing red pieces on the terrain, chances are that a green ship will approach you, and if you collect this ship, your weapons will be upgraded so that you shoot a laser beam instead. Keep collecting ships and you can shoot up to three laser beams at once. &#xA;&#xA;At the end of each zone, you will come across a boss that takes multiple hits to kill. If you manage to conquer all three zones, you are back to where you started. The whole point of this game is to earn as many points you can without losing all of your lives.</desc>

          <desc>Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world championships, so he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons. &#xA;&#xA;There are three main modes: &#xA;Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps. &#xA;&#xA;World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. &#xA;&#xA;Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).</desc>

          <desc>Gameplay involves the player trying to reach Paradise by exploring ten different lands, including desert, marshes, ruins, underground waterways, and forest. While exploring you can collect weapons, by destroying plants. A variety of in-game weapons can be found, some more powerful than others. Some weapons can be used against bosses, which can take a certain amount of hits from the player&#39;s default weapon, unless he has companions. The player&#39;s companions need to be hired with gold, and until he pays them they remain your enemies. Players must either bribe them or battle them to make them join his quest.</desc>

          <desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they&#39;re soon deep in trouble when they face &#34;Mad Dog&#34; Tannen&#39;s gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:&#xA;Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley&#39;s lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.&#xA;Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.&#xA;Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It&#39;s an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.&#xA;The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. &#xA;&#xA;The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the &#34;BB coin&#34;, which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent&#39;s playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she&#39;ll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</desc>

          <desc>Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken people hostage, and as a gunslinger, it&#39;s your job to shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won&#39;t score any points, but if you&#39;re too late, he&#39;ll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. &#xA;&#xA;If you&#39;re lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying &#34;I haven&#39;t got anything&#34;. That&#39;s when they will be replaced by bandits. &#xA;&#xA;Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there&#39;s more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you&#39;ll get three bags of gold coins.</desc>

          <desc>Basketball Nightmare is a basketball game where the player plays basketball against strange humanoid creatures on the court where the creature lives. The player must play and defeat each creature before moving onto a new place with a new harder opponent. The player starts of playing against Wolfs in the Forest and then, upon defeating that opponent, moves on to play Frogs at the Pond, One Eyed Aliens at the Waterfall, Vampires in the Skeleton Cave, Geishas in the Bamboo Forest, before finally playing against Samurais at the Shrine. If the player loses a match then that match can be replayed until won.&#xA;&#xA;The player at the start of each match gets to pick how long the match duration is out of the options of 15, 30, or 45 minutes (not in real time) before being placed on the court. When on the court the player always plays towards the right of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well timed button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to move, pass the ball, and jump. When jumping the player can shoot, with the accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass. When defending the player can cycle through the field or just simply run into the opponent to challenge for the ball. There are a few penalties that the player can get including but not limited to Travelling (not passing after jumping), Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent), and Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an opponent) with all the penalties resulting with the other team getting the ball on the side of the court.</desc>

          <desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.&#xA;&#xA;As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

          <desc>Bram Stroker&#39;s Dracula is a side-scroller platform game loosely based on the 1992 film of the same name. Players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first heading to Transylvania and then London.&#xA;&#xA;Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker&#39;s health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon. Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the &#34;Daytime&#34; and the &#34;Nighttime&#34;. These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</desc>

As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter. Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married. Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck&#39;s abilities and kidnaps him. Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad!&#xA;&#xA;The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</desc>

Cool Spot could also cling to and climb various things by jumping up in front of them. In each level the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level, which is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of &#34;spots&#34; that would change (usually increase) as the game progressed. &#34;Spots&#34; were placed across the level in large quantities.</desc>

One day, in the space above Earth, the evil Psy-Crow had cornered a rebel spaceship pilot who had stolen an &#34;Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit&#34; built by Professor Monkey-for-a-Head. The suit had been commissioned by the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt so that she could further conquer the galaxy. In the ensuing space fight, the suit was dropped to Earth, and fell on Jim. By a stroke of luck, Jim managed to land within the collar of the suit, and it ended up mutating him into the large and intelligent (at least by earthworm standards) superhero he is today.</desc>

          <desc>The gameplay is essentially side-scrolling, with horizontal, diagonal and vertical movement. Attacking enemies is accomplished by making Ecco ram into them at high speeds. Swimming could be made progressively faster by tapping a certain button, and the speed could be maintained by holding it down. Players can perform a purely aesthetic spin in the air when jumping out of the water. Two features of the game played on actual dolphin habits; one button causes Ecco to sing, allowing him to speak with other cetaceans and interact with certain objects. The same button is used for echolocation; holding it down would cause the song to return, generating a map of the area. Additionally, Ecco, being a mammal, has to surface periodically for air, or else find an air vent. If the &#34;air meter&#34; ran out, Ecco would lose health rapidly-this represented drowning.</desc>

But then, &#34;everything you&#39;ve got&#34; is quite a lot. Your F-16 can fly as high as 50,000 feet. It has a top speed of 1,450 mph. And missiles and cannons are just part of its standard armament. Its fully advanced electronic control pad supplies you with a wealth of valuable flight information. It even includes an automatic homing device as well as ECMs (electronic countermeasures). This is simulated flight at its most realistic. And simulated battle at its most deadly.</desc>

          <desc>Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.</desc>

          <desc>The background story of Fire &amp; Ice is quick to tell: A coyote (you) runs, throwing ice cubes, through various worlds. In the levels you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they&#39;re destroyed. The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world.&#xA;&#xA;Released in South America</desc>

          <desc>GP Rider is a simple, arcade motorbike game for the Master System. While the game does have its weaknesses, it is known to give an overall enjoyable high speed experience. The games most interesting aspect is that it is played permanently in a split screen, regardless of if one or two players are playing. If only one player is racing then the second player is replaced by a computer opponent called &#34;Wayne.&#34; Unique for a 8-bit game is that &#34;Wayne&#34; plays like a human player. He has good races and bad races. He passes riders and he has crashes. This is years ahead of its time considering other racing games of the era where the main opponent is programmed to always finish in the same position</desc>

          <desc>The game revolves around a dog and his family. Being one of the earliest adventure games for an 8-bit console system, the game tends to be simplistic compared to today&#39;s adventure games. As a Japan exclusive video game, literacy is required in the Japanese language in order to play the game. The character seems to have an anime-like influence as the people are watching out for the dog that is sitting on a log. Among the human beings, however, is an alien-like creature. While the literal translation would be Searching the Stars..., the actual alternative title is The Story of Mio.</desc>

          <desc>Impossible Mission has the user play a secret agent - attempting to stop an evil genius. Professor Elvin Atombender is believed to be tampering with national security computers. The player must penetrate Atombender&#39;s stronghold, racing against the clock to search the installation for pieces which form a password, all the while avoiding his deadly robots. Once in possession of all the password pieces, the player must correctly assemble the password pieces together and use the completed password in the main control room door - where the evil professor is hiding. One finds password pieces by searching furniture in the rooms. When searching, one can also find &#34;Lift Resets&#34; and &#34;Snoozes.&#34; They are used at computer terminals. The former will reset all moveable platforms, the latter will freeze all enemies in the room for a limited time. There are also two special rooms where additional lift resets and snoozes can be awarded for completing a musical puzzle.</desc>

You provide all the fourth quarter heroics, play-calling brilliance, and pinpoint passing as you hit the field against any of 28 pro teams. Call all your own plays! Each team has a playbook with 17 offensive and six defensive options. Pick the play that you think will work best, or take the advice of Joe Montana himself, as he recommends the play he would call in each situation. You control the action on the field by switching to the key players as the play unfolds. Your strength and speed will vary by position, just like the real sport. Knock helmets with the computer or punch holes in a friend&#39;s defense. Can you keep your head cool and your passing arm hot? Pick your team. Choose the plays. Think you have what it takes to be the next Joe Montana?</desc>

These bios featured short videos of the characters taking their fighting stances and text informing the motives for each character to enter the tournament. The game takes place in a fantasy setting, with most of the game&#39;s events occurring on the fictional realms of the Mortal Kombat series. The original game is notably the only title in the series that features only one realm, that being Earthrealm. The tournament featured in the story actually takes place fully at Shang Tsung&#39;s Island, located somewhere on Earth, with seven of its locations serving as Kombat Zones.</desc>

Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn&#39;s extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population&#39;s souls.&#xA;&#xA;A small team of Raiden&#39;s &#34;Chosen Warriors&#34; survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.</desc>

He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung&#39;s youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</desc>

Power-pellets or energizers change the ghosts, which reverse their course and can be eaten for bonus points. Fruit bonuses can be consumed for increasing point values, twice per level.</desc>

          <desc>A bunch of seedy punks - complete with mohawks - try to steal your girl. It&#39;s a new variation on the old &#34;Boy loses Girl&#34; theme. Only it&#39;s more like &#34;Boy loses life, if he doesn&#39;t get Girl back.&#34; Battle knife throwers, ferocious bulldogs, flying bottles, even the gang leader - whose name happens to be Mohikan. If it all seems hopelessly overwhelming, take heart. You&#39;re a high-ranking kung fu master. So you do have incredible martial arts skills in your favor. But then again, you don&#39;t have your girl. The punks do.</desc>

          <desc>The goal of each level is to safely get Tiki through the level, avoiding enemy fire and spikes, and rescue one of his kiwi friends at the end. The weaponry starts out as arrows, but pickups can change these into bombs, lasers, or bouncing fireballs. These act a little differently, and what is useful depends upon the player&#39;s location. A distinctive feature of this game is the ability to ride a variety of flying vehicles, including balloons, blimps, and UFOs. Vehicles can be found ready for use or can be stolen from an enemy.</desc>

Thus Ryu swears to recapture the scroll and the avenge the annihilation of his clan.&#xA;&#xA;The game is sidescrolling platformer/ beat&#39;em up title and incorporates most of the mechanics from the NES games: Ryu can jump and attack with his Dragon Sword. Furthermore, he can collect different kinds of Ninja Magic (which again vary form the powers in the NES games), from shuriken to fire wheels, which can only be used finitely many times, as the use up energy which again must be collected. However, instead of clinging to walls and climbing them, Ryu can push himself off the wall in this game, which must be applied for instance by jumping and forth between two close walls to get higher and higher.&#xA;&#xA;The goal of each level is simply to reach the end of the level before the time runs out. Each level is divided into several sections, and at the end of each level is a boss fight. After beating a boss, a cut scene is shown which continues the story about Ryu&#39;s quest for the Bushido scroll and his revenge.&#xA;&#xA;EU release</desc>

For example, upon completing the Jungle stage, an enemy leader is interrogated and the location of the enemy&#39;s concentration camp is found.

BRAINS - because you&#39;re in control of your car&#39;s speed and handling at a dangerous pace, you have to use your head and not just your hands to survive. So get geared for the ride of your life and stay alert. The track may look terrific, but at these speeds anything can turn into a danger zone.</desc>

Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

The monkey can jump higher than the other creatures and the tiger can run faster. Psycho also has an ally named Birdfly, who can be used as armor or as a boomerang. If Psycho is hit while carrying Birdfly, Birdfly goes away and the player does not lose a life.</desc>

What makes this game also unique is that unlike the NES (and Sega Master System Port, ironically) port of Operation Wolf, as long as the player has ammunition in the game, the light phaser&#39;s trigger can be held down to supply full automatic shooting. When the ammunition runs out though, the player will have to pull the trigger each time when shooting.</desc>

          <desc>Basic Sega shoot-em-up in which you must guide your ship through three zones while avoiding hazards. Your only weapon are bullets as your only defense, but if you shoot the flashing red pieces on the terrain, chances are that a green ship will approach you, and if you collect this ship, your weapons will be upgraded so that you shoot a laser beam instead. Keep collecting ships and you can shoot up to three laser beams at once. &#xA;&#xA;At the end of each zone, you will come across a boss that takes multiple hits to kill. If you manage to conquer all three zones, you are back to where you started. The whole point of this game is to earn as many points you can without losing all of your lives.</desc>

The monkey can jump higher than the other creatures and the tiger can run faster. Psycho also has an ally named Birdfly, who can be used as armor or as a boomerang. If Psycho is hit while carrying Birdfly, Birdfly goes away and the player does not lose a life.</desc>

Your fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes, tanks and ground targets to achieve victory.

Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy everything on the screen, although you can&#39;t use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is provided.</desc>

          <desc>If you think this is just another shoot &#39;em up game, think again. Nothing demands more skill, more daring, more intense gameplay than SHOOTING GALLERY! And hopefully, you&#39;ve got what it takes to survive. A keen eye. A steady hand. And the invincible Sega Light Phaser that actually records misses. If you aim straight and aim on target, just maybe you&#39;ll be able to shoot everything from iron-clad Spaceships to incredibly fast Blimps. But don&#39;t despair if the going gets tough. Because it gets tough for everyone.</desc>

          <desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.&#xA;&#xA;On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough &#34;proof&#34; of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won&#39;t be easy since the Space Mutants are &#34;using&#34; human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.&#xA;&#xA;The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.</desc>

          <desc>Dr. Robotnik has assumed control of Mt. Mobius and turned it into a mechanical base. Utilizing energy produced by the magma flowing under the volcano, this new monstrosity (the Veg-O-Fortress) has the power to transform helpless animals into robot slaves at an astounding rate. Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails fly onto the scene to mount an aerial assault, but Sonic is knocked off the wings of Tails&#39; airplane by a blast from the fortress. He falls into the water, but is rescued and taken to the subterranean levels of the Veg-O-Fortress. The fortress must be destroyed from the inside-out, and the only way to make that happen is to trigger an eruption in the volcano it&#39;s built on. Sonic knows this can be done by removing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable. Robotnik, however, is also aware of the fragile relationship that exists between the Emeralds and the mountain, and he&#39;s set up an elaborate Pinball Defense System to make sure the precious jewels don&#39;t go anywhere.</desc>

          <desc>Sonic&#39;s Edusoft is an unreleased educational game for the Sega Master System developed in 1991 by Tiertex. The unofficially licensed game had been unknown until a Wikipedia page was created in September 2006. &#xA;&#xA;There are over 15 levels in the game. All of them involve problem solving and for every problem solved your character will move forward eventually reaching the end of the screen and clearing the stage. Your opponent varies depending on the speed setting set at the options screen. For example, if you choose Snail you will race a Moto Bug, but when hare is selected you will race a much faster Rabbit, and the time limit is decreased.&#xA;&#xA;Most of the levels involve find the word puzzles where you have to spell out a word using the available letters. These levels are sometimes interrupted by a match the letters segment, where you must find a certain amount of matching letters among the available letters shown onscreen. The match the letters segment is somewhat broken because sometimes no matching letters are ever shown, or actually matching the letters may give a wrong answer anyway. In those cases you have to select the wrong answer to get the right answer.&#xA;&#xA;Other levels involve solving mathematical equations: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.</desc>

As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 &#39;legs&#39; with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.&#xA;&#xA;You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.</desc>

The player explores temples and defeats enemies like ghosts, ninja, and feral beasts. There are also villages to explore and people to talk to as the player assembles clues on who desecrated his home town&#39;s temple and killed its guardians. The quest takes the player across medieval Japan and to the Underworld. Unlike most games, death does not lead to game over or even a loss of money or experience points. Instead, the player has to use a password in order to resurrect themselves from the dead.</desc>

Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.&#xA;&#xA;Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.</desc>

He announces to New York that a bomb has been planted somewhere in the city, and that it&#39;ll go off in 24 hours! What&#39;s worse, he lays the blame on Spider-Man, and now the webslinger is on his own, and on the run from the police. Spidey smells a rat, and he knows what he must do.</desc>

The levels are made up of forests, hills, oceans, caves, ice palaces and occasionally mountains lands. The levels always run from left-to-right, with some vertical movement.&#xA;&#xA;Tom-Tom can arm himself with a stone hammer, which he can throw at oncoming foes, a skateboard with which he can rush through the levels and survive one attack by an enemy, and temporary protection by a fairy which allows him to destroy foes by simply running into them. All of the aforementioned power-ups are obtained by breaking open eggs.</desc>

Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as Astrix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Astrix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Oblix is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).&#xA;&#xA;Astrix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls Dogmatix. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.</desc>

          <desc>A bunch of seedy punks - complete with mohawks - try to steal your girl. It&#39;s a new variation on the old &#34;Boy loses Girl&#34; theme. Only it&#39;s more like &#34;Boy loses life, if he doesn&#39;t get Girl back.&#34; Battle knife throwers, ferocious bulldogs, flying bottles, even the gang leader - whose name happens to be Mohikan. If it all seems hopelessly overwhelming, take heart. You&#39;re a high-ranking kung fu master. So you do have incredible martial arts skills in your favor. But then again, you don&#39;t have your girl. The punks do.</desc>

Lord British wished to base people&#39;s well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.

The player must guide Tom-Tom through seven &#34;areas&#34;, each consisting of four &#34;rounds&#34;. The levels are made up of forests, hills, oceans, caves, ice palaces and occasionally mountains lands. The levels always run from left-to-right, with some vertical movement.&#xA;&#xA;Tom-Tom can arm himself with a stone hammer, which he can throw at oncoming foes, a skateboard with which he can rush through the levels and survive one attack by an enemy, and temporary protection by a fairy which allows him to destroy foes by simply running into them. All of the aforementioned power-ups are obtained by breaking open eggs.</desc>
